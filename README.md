MediCare+ is a full-stack, production-ready Hospital Appointment and Workflow Management System developed using Django and Django REST Framework, designed to simulate real-world hospital scheduling with strong emphasis on data integrity, concurrency control, and scalable backend architecture. The system implements structured role-based access control (RBAC) for Admin, Doctor, and Patient, ensuring secure authentication, session management, and OTP-based password recovery. Doctors can dynamically mark availability, automatically generate time slots within defined working hours, and manage appointments through a dedicated dashboard, while patients can book, cancel, and monitor appointments through a responsive interface.

A core architectural highlight of the system is its robust concurrency handling. To prevent race conditions and double-booking, appointment booking operations are wrapped in atomic database transactions, and critical rows are locked using select_for_update() to enforce row-level consistency during simultaneous booking attempts. Additionally, a strict One-to-One relationship between Appointment and TimeSlot is enforced at the database level to maintain slot uniqueness and prevent duplication. The system also integrates a dynamic priority-based queue where patients are ranked using defined parameters such as age and emergency status. If a booked appointment is cancelled, the system automatically promotes the highest-priority patient from the waiting queue in a transaction-safe manner and triggers an email notification, ensuring fair and automated slot redistribution.

From a deployment perspective, the application is configured for production with PostgreSQL for relational integrity, Gunicorn as the WSGI server, WhiteNoise for static file management, and environment-variable-based secret management for secure configuration. The architecture follows modular app separation (accounts, doctors, appointments, analytics) to ensure maintainability and scalability. Overall, the project demonstrates strong practical expertise in backend engineering, transactional database design, concurrency control, authentication systems, and production deployment practices.
